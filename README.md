# Typicode Posts

This react app is designed as a task for 18F take home tests.
The app uses apis from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ to populate the UI. A search functionality is to filter the posts fetched from API.
Autocomplete is enabled for the search input using datalist technique. Furthermore, pagination is enabled on the site to improve the visibility
of all the posts fetched from the API.
